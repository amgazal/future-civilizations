  <!-- Vision -->
  <section>
    <h3>Conference Vision</h3>
    <div class="card">
      <p class="muted">
        The Future Civilizations Conference brings together faculty, students, and external speakers to
        explore how artificial intelligence, robotics, and autonomous systems are reshaping the foundations
        of human life. Using the idea of the “next human city” as a central lens, the conference examines
        how emerging technologies will transform social structures, economic systems, environmental sustainability,
        and even the possibility of off-world settlements.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        Rather than treating the future as abstract speculation, this conference creates space for
        interdisciplinary dialogue that connects technical innovation with human values, ethical responsibility,
        and long-term societal planning.
